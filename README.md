# MARS-Programming-Autonomy
This repository shall hold the code running on the NVidia Jetson TX2. The purpose of the code will be to perform high-level evaluations of sensory data, updating its conceptions of the environment around it, planning a trajectory to achieve a goal, and sending commands to the Arduinos to interpret. This will be a catkin workspace, with ROS functioning as the middleware tying all the scripts we write together into a cohesive whole.
